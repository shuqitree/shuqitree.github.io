Since\nattending the University of Virginia, I had been trying to spot an\nEastern Box Turtle in its native habitat—a goal that now seemed within\nreach.</p>\n<p>The journey began at 8 a.m., and we trudged through woods, over\nstreams, and across meadows, eyes peeled for any signs of turtle life.\nBy 1 p.m., spirits were starting to wane. The adventure seemed\nfruitless, and we reluctantly decided to head back to the parking lot,\nwrapping up what felt like a failed expedition.</p>\n<p>Just as we were about to abandon all hope, a distant rustle from the\nunderbrush caught my attention. Though squirrels had been frequent\nculprits of such noises, something was different this time—the bushes\nstopped shaking. A silent agreement passed between us: This was no\nsquirrel.</p>\n<p>We approached cautiously, the air thick with anticipation. And there\nit was: an Eastern Box Turtle, its ornate shell glistening in the\ndappled sunlight, as if waiting just for us.</p>\n<p>The moment was surreal. Hours of walking, years of dreaming, and a\nlifetime of loving these remarkable creatures had led to this single,\nunforgettable encounter. As I stood there, taking in every detail, I\nfelt an overwhelming sense of gratitude. The long walk had not been in\nvain; it was a walk to discovery, a journey to fulfilling a dream.</p>\n<p><em>Extending a special thanks to\n<a href=\"https://shuqitree.github.io/the-turtles-whisper\" style=\"color: #90538F; text-decoration: none;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.textDecoration='underline';\" onmouseout=\"this.style.textDecoration='none';\"><em>Mace\nBrowning</em></a>.

I’m Shuqi Jiang, currently a Software Engineer at DMV area.\nBefore that I graduated from University of Virgina with a Master degree\nin Computer Science. My academic foundation is built upon a Bachelor’s\nin Network Security from Wuhan University. Outside the classroom, I am\ndeeply passionate about photography. While I appreciate digital cameras\nand have had the privilege to work with some of the finest models like\nthe <em>Hasselblad X2D</em>, <em>BMPCC 6K</em>, and the <em>Fujifilm\nXT-2</em>, I also have a profound love for film. In fact, I’ve nearly\ntried every film camera the world has to offer. My personal favorite\nremains the <em>Mamiya RB67</em>, especially when loaded with the 120\nformat <em>Kodak Portra 400</em> film. Whether I’m behind the lens or\nsipping on a latte, life is a quest for beauty and moments. This quest\nis evident not just in my photos, but also in my loyalty to Starbucks,\nreflected by the over <em>1500</em> stars I’ve accumulated in their\nrewards program. Every star is a testament to my love for their brews\nand my penchant for seeking out life’s little pleasures!!!</p>\n<p>The idea of this website comes from\n<a href=\"https://jolinnali.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #f58ea9; text-decoration: none;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.textDecoration='underline';\" onmouseout=\"this.style.textDecoration='none';\"><em>Jolinna\nLi</em></a> 🫶!!!</p>\n<p>For collaborations, or just a chat over coffee:\n<a href='mailto:shuqitree@gmail.com'><u> shuqitree@gmail.com</u></a></p>\n",
