I’m Shuqi Jiang, currently immersed in a Master’s program in\nComputer Science at the University of Virginia. My academic foundation\nis built upon a Bachelor’s in Network Security from Wuhan University.\nOutside the classroom, I am deeply passionate about photography. While I\nappreciate digital cameras and have had the privilege to work with some\nof the finest models like the <em>Hasselblad X2D</em>, <em>BMPCC\n6K</em>, and the <em>Fujifilm XT-2</em>, I also have a profound love for\nfilm. In fact, I’ve nearly tried every film camera the world has to\noffer. My personal favorite remains the <em>Mamiya RB67</em>, especially\nwhen loaded with the 120 format <em>Kodak Portra 400</em> film. Whether\nI’m behind the lens or sipping on a latte, life is a quest for beauty\nand moments. This quest is evident not just in my photos, but also in my\nloyalty to Starbucks, reflected by the over <em>1500</em> stars I’ve\naccumulated in their rewards program. Every star is a testament to my\nlove for their brews and my penchant for seeking out life’s little\npleasures!!!</p>\n<p>\nContact: <a href='mailto:shuqitree@gmail.com'><u>\nshuqitree@gmail.com</u></a>\n</p>\n","group":"about"}}
