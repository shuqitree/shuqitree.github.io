I'm Shuqi Jiang, currently immersed in a Master's program in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. My academic foundation is built upon a Bachelor's in Network Security from Wuhan University.  Outside the classroom, I am deeply passionate about photography. While I appreciate digital cameras and have had the privilege to work with some of the finest models like the _Hasselblad X2D_, _BMPCC 6K_, and the _Fujifilm XT-2_, I also have a profound love for film. In fact, I've nearly tried every film camera the world has to offer. My personal favorite remains the _Mamiya RB67_, especially when loaded with the 120 format _Kodak Portra 400_ film. Whether I'm behind the lens or sipping on a latte, life is a quest for beauty and moments. This quest is evident not just in my photos, but also in my loyalty to Starbucks, reflected by the over _1500_ stars I've accumulated in their rewards program. Every star is a testament to my love for their brews and my penchant for seeking out life's little pleasures!!!\n\n<p>\nContact:  <a href='mailto:shuqitree@gmail.com'><u>  shuqitree@gmail.com</u></a>\n</p>",
