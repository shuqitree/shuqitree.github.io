## My Favorite Color

There are only two seasons in my hometown, winter and summer. Spring is very short, as short as a week, so I've never gotten the full picture of spring. It was only upon my footsteps treading the grounds of UVA that a revelation dawned upon me. My favorite color wasn't just a standard hue like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_rUYuFtNO4" target="_blank" style="color: #FF0000; text-decoration: none;" onmouseover="this.style.textDecoration='underline';" onmouseout="this.style.textDecoration='none';">_Red_</a>, _Blue_, or _Green_. It is the vibrant mosaic of _Spring_ !!!

It was more than just a tree; it felt like a reflection of a part of me. Much like how "æ ‘" is rooted in my name, this tree, isolated yet powerful, was a testament to the beauty of endurance and the profound stories solitude can tell. As I captured its skeletal frame against the cold backdrop, I felt a bond, a shared understanding with this solitary guardian of the frozen expanse.

## Embracing the Sea Again

As the world slowly awakened from its COVID slumber, I found myself by the shore, feeling the familiar embrace of the sea. Its timeless waves whispered of perseverance and new beginnings. It was a reunion not just with nature, but with hope itself.

## About Me

Hey! I'm Shuqi Jiang, currently immersed in a Master's program in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. My academic foundation is built upon a Bachelor's in Network Security from Wuhan University.  Outside the classroom, I am deeply passionate about photography. While I appreciate digital cameras and have had the privilege to work with some of the finest models like the _Hasselblad X2D_, _BMPCC 6K_, and the _Fujifilm XT-2_, I also have a profound love for film. In fact, I've nearly tried every film camera the world has to offer. My personal favorite remains the _Mamiya RB67_, especially when loaded with the 120 format _Kodak Portra 400_ film. Whether I'm behind the lens or sipping on a latte, life is a quest for beauty and moments. This quest is evident not just in my photos, but also in my loyalty to Starbucks, reflected by the over _1500_ stars I've accumulated in their rewards program. Every star is a testament to my love for their brews and my penchant for seeking out life's little pleasures!!!
