The creative process, like the scientific process, is full of trial and error. While exploring the inner workings of our biological worlds and imaginative ones, road blocks inevitably arise. So when and where does creativity emerge? Ideas come trickling in, often in moments of connection between people of all walks of life. Like the complex ecological networks that exist around us, one idea feeds into the next, and it’s sometimes hard to tell who inspired who! In her experimental documentary a rolling stone gathers no moss, Jolinna captures the mundane moments when artists engage in collaboration, both in the loose narrative and the form of the film. It’s a symbiotic relationship, the artists in the film provide her with inspiration for the film itself, and the work she documents inspire her own fantastical visions that appear later in the film. She then in turn captures and honors their artistic undertakings, shedding light on their vulnerabilities.

## Rooted
Autumn Samone, in her series of images in _Rooted_, taken by Jolinna Li, creates a tree sculpture with synthetic hair, framing it alongside her body and the ethereal forest floor. Often considered "natural looking", protective hair styles in black communities often use synthetic elements. Through these plays on what is considered "natural", Samone connects the performance that is culturally integral to black identity to her own bodily performance in front of the camera.

## About Me

Hey! I'm Shuqi Jiang, currently immersed in a Master's program in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. My academic foundation is built upon a Bachelor's in Network Security from Wuhan University. Outside the classroom, I am deeply passionate about photography. While I appreciate digital cameras and have had the privilege to work with some of the finest models like the _Hasselblad X2D_, _BMPCC 6K_, and the _Fujifilm XT2_, I also have a profound love for film. In fact, I've nearly tried every film camera the world has to offer. My personal favorite remains the _Mamiya RB67_, especially when loaded with the 120 format _Kodak Portra 400_ film. Whether I'm behind the lens or sipping on a latte, life is a quest for beauty and moments. This quest is evident not just in my photos, but also in my loyalty to Starbucks, reflected by the over _1500_ stars I've accumulated in their rewards program. Every star is a testament to my love for their brews and my penchant for seeking out life's little pleasures!!!
